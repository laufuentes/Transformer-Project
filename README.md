# TransformerProject
## Introduction
This is the github repository for our project in the class MÃ©thodes de l'IA (Methods of Artificial Intelligence). The project consists of implementing a Transformer model for sentiment analysis for movie reviews. The model predicts whether a review is good (1), or bad (0). The architecture is based on the Transformer architecture from the paper "Attention is all you need".

To use the streamlit application, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your disc.
2. Create a new environment, for example with anaconda.
3. Install the requirements by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `conda install --file requirements.txt`
4. cd into `TransformerProject/src`
5. Type `streamlit run application.py`
6. The application should now open in your browser.
